# Cricket_Game
A simple Cricket game project implemented using conditional statments (if,if-else).

****I. Description****

This is a simple cricket game to understand the working of conditional statements. Here, the user plays against computer. After the toss, he/she can choose between the numbers 1-6, within 12 deliveries(2 overs) with a maximum of 2 wickets, to set a target(if batting first). This is followed up in the second innings as part of the chase.

**II. Technology Stack**

Language: Python

IDE used: Pycharm(3.6)

**III. **Workflow****
1. Firstly, program starts with user input, call for the toss, if user wins the toss user should choose either batting or bowling. If not, computer chooses randomly to bat or bowl.
2. Condition 1: Who chose to bat first has to set target without losing 2 wickets in 12 balls (2 overs). User and computer has to choose numbers between 1 to 6 only.
3. Score and remaining balls is shown for each ball.
4. First innings will complete if 12 balls are bowled or if 2 wickets are lost. Runs and wickets will be stored in respective variables.
5. Similarly, second innings will be played. One who batted first is going to bowl now and vice-versa
6. One who chases the score under given condition user/computer is going to win the match. 

**IV. Applications & Future enhancements**

This can be enhanced as a backend for mobile applications with interactive UI.
